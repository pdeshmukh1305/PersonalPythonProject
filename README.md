# PersonalPythonProject
This was a project I did for predicting the future product requirements. I was given the sales data. I had to decide the rationale for the "Top 5" products. Then I used Python and tested several algorithms on time-series data to generate predictions of how many quantities of those 5 products to stock up.


Please note that you would need a Python version of 3.8 for running fbprophet successfully. It's not supported on v 3.9.
